            <h3>Bubblish & Sensitive Girl</h3>
            <p>On the outside she was happy and bubbly.Being sensitive is often a good thing. It helps respond to the
                environment and people. It helps us being alert of the danger. Sensitivity is also the basis of sympathy
                and
                empathy. Being sensitive helps build and maintain personal and professional relationships. It helps in
                decision-making, personally and professionally.

            <p>
                Web Development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private
                network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website, rather, its
                all about the coding and programming that powers the websites functionality.
